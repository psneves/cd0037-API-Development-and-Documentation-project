## Starting and Submitting the Project

Project was Forked from [Fork](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo) which is project repository.

## About the Stack

### Composition
It is considered by:
1. Python Flask Backend
2. Javascript React Frontend

We started the full stack application for you. It is designed with some key functional areas:

### Backend

The [backend](./backend/README.md) directory contains a partially completed Flask and SQLAlchemy server. `__init__.py` defines endpoints and models.py refer to DB and SQLAlchemy setup. These are the files you'd want to edit in the backend:

1. `backend/flaskr/__init__.py`
2. `backend/test_flaskr.py`

> View the [Backend README](./backend/README.md) for more details.

### Frontend

The [frontend](./frontend/README.md) directory contains a complete Javascript React frontend to consume the data from the Flask server. If you have prior experience building a frontend application, you should feel free to edit the endpoints as you see fit for the backend you design.
